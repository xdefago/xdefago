Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am working as a professor at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp) (Japan), where I teach first year computer science and literacy classes in the bachelor program, as well as distributed algorithms and fault-tolerant distributed algorithms in the master program.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on fault-tolerant distributed systems and cooperative mobile robots as my main professional research activities. I have some side projects that are only indirectly related to my research, such as a Rust crate for computing confidence intervals: [`stats-ci`@crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/stats-ci) / [`stats-ci`@github](https://github.com/xdefago/stats-ci).
- ðŸ”­ I have some personal projects on the side, mostly related to embedded systems and home automation, such as a weather clock.
