Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on fault-tolerant distributed systems and cooperative mobile robots as my main professional research activities. I have some side projects that are only indirectly related to my research, such as a Rust crate for computing confidence intervals: `stats-ci`.
- ğŸ”­ I have some personal projects on the side, mostly related to embedded systems and home automation, such as a weather clock.
